## Keynote: 9 Ways to Stop Hurting and Start Helping Women in Tech
_Brianna Wu_

### Intro
* Nobody wants to talk about gender issues
* Talking about what women face in technology is critical
* *Examples of gender controversies on slide*

### #1
* Stop treating sexism like another controversy to discuss
    * Arguing against someone's opinion means you dismiss that person's experiences
* Start showing basic sensitivity
    * If someone was getting divorced, would you disgree that it's difficult? *You'd be a jerk if you do that!*
    * It's difficult to talk about

### #2
* Stop telling women that their experiences are wrong
    * Even if the opinion is incorrect, the emotion is always true
* Start respecting people's lived experiences
    * Respect the stories - just listen

### #3
* Stop making women in tech issues all about men
    * It's not about you (men)
    * Men's views are already represented
    * Learn the ring theory to not be obnoxious
        * Comfort flows towards the center of the circle
        * Complaints flow out from the center
* Start listening

### #4
* Start doing your part to help women with children to stay in technology
    * Someone has to have the children, and it's expensive
    * Mothers feel left out of decision making after having children
    * It's about respect
* Start widening your network to include women
    * Women face more inertia in networking in tech
    * Networking in bars isn't terribly productive
    * Unintentional bias

### #5
* Stop identifying yourself as a "nice guy"
    * Prevents you from hearing feedback about yourself
    * Sexism exists everywhere but nobody identifies themselves as a sexist
* Start accepting that we all have a part to play in making this better
    * If none of us take responsibility and learn, nothing will change
    * We all make mistakes
    * Think critically about your behavior

*Oops -- I think I missed #6!*

### #7
* Stop thinking sexism in tech is a Mad Men moment
    * Sexism in tech isn't like old stuff like saying women belong in the kitchen
    * It's death by 1,000 cuts -- a series of microaggressions
    * Men don't see the thousands of things that push women away
* Start understanding that sexism is a lot more subtle
    * It's the little things that push women out of tech
    * Don't "mansplain" when talking to women
    * Don't make masculine assumptions when describing jobs

### #8
* Absence of privilege isn't oppression
    * Culture of technology has been built in men's image
* Start realizing that tech will become more diverse

### #9
* Stop thinking it's up to women to solve these issues
* Start the conversatoin right now
